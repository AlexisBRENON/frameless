Frameless is a proof-of-concept library for working with [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) using more expressive types.
It consists of the following modules:

* `cats` for using Spark with [cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats)
* `dataframe` for more strongly typed `DataFrame`s
* `dataset` for more strongly typed `Dataset`s

The Frameless project and contributors support the
[Typelevel](http://typelevel.org/) [Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html) and want all its
associated channels (e.g. GitHub, Gitter) to be a safe and friendly environment for contributing and learning.
