Frameless is a way of using [Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/sql/) without completely giving up types. The general
idea is having a phantom type that mirrors the value-level computation at the type-level. All heavy lifting is still
done by the original Spark API.

The Frameless project and contributors support the
[Typelevel](http://typelevel.org/) [Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html) and wants all its
associated channels (e.g. GitHub, Gitter) to be a safe and friendly environment for contributing and learning.
